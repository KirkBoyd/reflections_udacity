What happens when you initialize a repo? Why do you need to do it?
  It creates the repo with git, and starts tracking changes. You can check with 'git status'. You need to do it in order to use the directory as a repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area is the stuff you're getting ready to commit. The working directory is the stuff actually on your computer in the file I think. The repository is the thing that actually goes online I believe.
