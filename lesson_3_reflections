When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when you use multiple computers, want to back up your files online, or want to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you are working with others you might not want to pull everything

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork - github only version of clones
  Clone - works in both, copies an entire repository
  branch - subsections of repositories that can be modified independently

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  Then if someone else updates it is easier to compare for merge history.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Probably by doing it how I have been. Just sharing files with no definite structure like GitHub lays out.
  It would be easier because I wouldn't have to spend hours taking this course and get distracted by committing and pulling etc...
  It would be harder to keep track of who changes what and what is the latest stable version.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  When you want to test stuff that might break the code, or something that you don't know if you will implement.
  The benefits of this are kind of self explanatory, the only benefit of committing directly to master is less work.
